### 👀 About Me  
- 🌐 **Passionate about** **web development**, **language translation**, and **medical innovation**.

- 🛠️ **I migrated the production website from Amazon Lightsail to a fully serverless architecture on AWS Amplify, with domain hosting and DNS powered by Route 53. This upgrade streamlined continuous deployment, improved performance, and enhanced overall reliability.**
  
- ☁️ **Cloud and Services** I build scalable, secure, serverless applications using:: **AWS**, **Python**, **React + Node**, **Amplify**, **ECR** **HTML**, and **CSS**. My experience includes architecting solutions with **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **Amazon S3**, **DynamoDB**, **AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)**, **CloudFormation**, **Amazon CloudWatch**, **AWS STS(Security Token Services)**, **Amazon Cognito**, **Amazon Transcribe** and many many more!!!!!
  
- **🐳 Container Orchestration and Deployment Expertise • Amazon EKS • Kubernetes • Jenkins • Terraform • GitHub Actions • Argo CD** I've worked with Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) and Docker, enabling me to design, deploy, and manage scalable containerized applications.
  
- 🧠 **Skilled in** **AI model training** with **ethical guardrails** (Bedrock + beyond).

### What I do:

Implement Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation and SAM

Design microservices architectures and RESTful APIs

Build and deploy serverless, event-driven, cloud-native solutions
